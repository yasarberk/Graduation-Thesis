+ CCTV recordings collected and labelled.
+ YOLOv5 model was used for object detection and bytetrack algorithm was used for object tracking.
+ The algorithm that detects the number of people entering and leaving any place has been implemented in the model.
+ 99.2% accuracy value achieved.
+ You can check the demo from below.
